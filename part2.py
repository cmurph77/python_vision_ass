# //Part II. Locate the table tennis table.  You must now locate the corners of the table (the outside of the
# // white lines) using edge detection, and then transform the image so that you have a plan view of the table.
# // Determine how well your approach works on the static images of the tables provided. Ensure that you use
# // techniques which can be used in general (e.g. ideally the techniques would cope with changes in lighting, etc.).
# // An
# alyse how well your approach works on the static images of the tables provided, and later on the table tennis
# // video.  Note that in the report you may need to use some of the Learning and Evaluation section of the course,
# // also in section 9.3 of “Computer Vision with OpenCV”  (when reporting performance).
